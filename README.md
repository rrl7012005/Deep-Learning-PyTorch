# Deep-Learning-PyTorch

This repository contains summarized notes and code for several deep learning concepts in PyTorch. Some of the models were improved on. The notes are in my own words.  

Course by David Bourke "Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning": https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_extra_resources/

Concepts covered in the notebooks include:

- Computer Vision in PyTorch
- Creating custom dataset pipelines
- Data Augmentation in PyTorch
- Transfer Learning PyTorch
- Converting notebooks to scripts
- Experiment Tracking with Tensorboard
- ViT from scratch
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Deployment

Improved models were on a smaller version of the FoodVision101 dataset

- The course obtained 26% accuracy with a CNN, I improved it to 88% accuracy by redeveloping the architecture
- The course obtained 85% accuracy with Transfer Learning, I obtained 98.7% accuracy
